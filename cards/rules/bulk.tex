\begin{card}{Rule}{}{Bulk}[CRB][272]

\Flavor{%
Carrying especially heavy or unwieldy items can make it more difficult for you
to move, as can overloading yourself with too much gear. The Bulk value of an
item reflects how difficult the item is to handle, representing its size,
weight, and general awkwardness.
