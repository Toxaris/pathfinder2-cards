\begin{card}{Item}{0}{Flint and Steel}[CRB][290]

Flint and steel are useful in creating a fire if you have the time to catch a spark, 
though using them is typically too time-consuming to be practical during an encounter. 
Even in ideal conditions, using flint and steel to light a flame requires using at least 3 actions, 
and often significantly longer.
